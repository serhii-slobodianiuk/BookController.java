# Simple library
Spring Boot (using Docker) application that will represent a simple "Library" system with two main entities - User and Book. 
A user can have many books and a book can only belong to 1 user. 
A book can be free (allowed to be taken by other users) or taken (not allowed to be taken by other users).
